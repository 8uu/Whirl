# **Whirl**

## **Team Name: Whirl**

## **Team Number: 4**

## **Team Members: Tucker Miles, Matt Mohandiss, David Nguyen, Vicki Tang, Jiuru Zhu**

## **Introduction**

With 65 total issues so far, and 60 of them closed, we have achieved a good minimum viable product which
includes many of the core features of the application. This gives us a solid foundation with which we plan build more functionality into, refine, and repeat. As of now, we are able to
create accounts, login and authenticate users, create "rides" which others can join, and generate a list of these "rides" with the information being pulled from out databases. Overall, we
haven't made any significant changes to our initial design requirements, and are staying fairly true to our original plan of action.

## **Customer Value**

Explain difference of schedule from proposal.md. Why did we do this, and what did it do. Did it cause any issues?

## **Technology**

System architecture, details about design and implementation. What were out goals (just look at mileston issues). What works at this point in time? Include screenshots of stuff working. What tests have we run (think login issues etc.) And lastly, what are our goals for the next iteration.

## **Team**

What roles did we partake in in this iteration, and do we or do we not expect them to change.

## **Project Management**

Are we on schedule? Provide updates to schedule since beginning of semester

## **Reflection**

What went well? What didn't? What will we do differently?
