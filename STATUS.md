# **Whirl**

## **Team Name: Whirl**

## **Team Number: 4**

## **Team Members: Tucker Miles, Matt Mohandiss, David Nguyen, Vicki Tang, Jiuru Zhu**

## **Introduction**

With 65 total issues so far, and 60 of them closed, we have achieved a good minimum viable product which
includes many of the core features of the application. This gives us a solid foundation with which we plan build more functionality into, refine, and repeat. As of now, we are able to
create accounts, login and authenticate users, create "rides" which others can join, and generate a list of these "rides" with the information being pulled from out databases. Overall, we
haven't made any significant changes to our initial design requirements, and are staying fairly true to our original plan of action.

## **Customer Value**

Currently, we have altered the schdedule from the 
proposal.md due to our team members needing to take more time to get started and to familiarize themselves more with the framework. Also, we used more time to plan out the structure of our application with wireframes and a workflow chart. Allocating more time to that, we have been able to create a minimum viable product with more structure and organization and less bugs. The difference of the schedule has not caused any issues for our team or the project. It has helped us visualize our goals and how to split up the work.   

## **Technology**

As far as system architecture goes, the tech stack we initally planned to use is still the same. We have not run into too many issues with incompatibilty, or just the outright inability to complete a task. ...

System architecture, details about design and implementation. What were out goals (just look at mileston issues). What works at this point in time? Include screenshots of stuff working. What tests have we run (think login issues etc.) And lastly, what are our goals for the next iteration.
