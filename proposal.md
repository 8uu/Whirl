# Section 1: Introduction
## What is the project?
- Whirl is a ideshare app for college students. We plan to helps students find rides around campus or home for break.
## What is the motivation for the project?
- Bad parking conditions on campus
- Some students don't have cars
- Help students afford trips
- Keeps students from being alone on long trips

<!---Novel question--->
## Whirl is not a typical ridesharing app. Whirl is more based on carpooling for a student-only community. We will make transportation more affordable for our users, and plan to make safety one of our main priorities.
