# **Whirl**
### Team Name: Whirl 
### Team Members: Tucker Miles, Matt Mohandiss, David Nguyen, Vicki Tang, Jiuru Zhu




## **Introduction**
### What is Whirl?
- Whirl is a ride-sharing app for college students. We plan to helps students find rides around campus or home for break.
### Team Whirl's Motivation
- Bad parking conditions on campus
- Some students don't have cars
- Help students afford trips
- Keeps students from being alone on long trips
- Safety
### Market Context
- Whirl is not a typical ride-sharing app. Whirl is more based on carpooling for a student-only community. We will make transportation more affordable for our users, and plan to make safety one of our main priorities.
### Our Background
- As of now, we have all been through the same computer science classes (through COSC 302), so we have a good base knowledge of general programming practices and procedures. Some of us have experience with front end design and web development, and one of us has experience with mobile development.



## **Customer Value**
### Customer Need
- Our primary customers will be college students who want safe rides back to campus while on breaks, and to/from events around campus. We are doing this because we want to prioritize the safety of college students, and take into consideration the cost it takes to travel.
### Proposed Solution
- From the customer's point of view, our solution will take the anonymity out of carpooling, as it will be a student-only network. They will be able to get safe rides to and from their home and events around campus. When compared to current ride-sharing services, Whirl will be more cost-effective and inclusive to students.
### Measures of Success
- We will know our app is successful if students are able to get free/cheap rides when they need them and feel safe while doing so.




## **Proposed Solution & Technology**
### Technology We Will Deliver
  - From the developer's point of view, our software will offer an easy way for students to find rides to and from any point of interest. 
  - Users will be able to post places they are going, and accept additional riders under their own circumstances.
  - Users will be able to find rides, and view the driver's and other rider's profiles before joining them.
  - Users will be able to rate the driver and the rider on their experiences.
  ...
   - A minimal viable system for us is to create a restricted community in which only students can offer rides to and from places of interests for other students. Once we achieve this, we can add features such as profiling functionality, ride restrictions, and driving incentives.
  - As far as testing goes, we will be creating numerous users and running through all of the applications processes numerous times. Each time new functionality is implemented, regression testing will be performed in order to maintain stability of the application as a whole.
### Technology We Will Use
  - As far as our technology goes, we plan to use Flutter and Firebase. Flutter is a framework used for mobile development which is backed by Google's Dart programming language. Firebase is a platform which provides many useful services in order to build functionality into our application.
  - We chose to use Flutter because our stack will natively compile into both an Android and an iOS application. If it weren't for this, we would have to maintain two completely separate code-bases if we wanted to have cross-platform functionality. In addition to this, Flutter has an ability to "hot-reload" in the development process, keeping us from having to rebuild the app in its entirety each time a change is made, and this makes for quick, easy incremental development. Another advantage of using this technology is the quick and easy discoverability of a vast amount of packages. As an example, we will use some sort of maps/location plugin, and finding one that will work for us is easy due to Flutter's central package repository.



## **Section 4: Team**
### Skills
- One of us has full-stack experience with mobile development, we also have some general experience with data-basing, front-end and back-end development, and building desktop applications. Specifically, only one of us has a high level of experience with Flutter and Firebase, while the rest of us are currently getting familiar with the technology.
### Roles
- We plan to rotate roles throughout the development process. Doing this will allow us to all gain some familiarity with each component of the development process.




## **Section 5: Project Management**
### Schedule
  -We do believe completion of our system is feasible, and we have no specific set meeting times. We will generally meet face-to-face in class, and utilize discord to work as a group while away from class.

### Constraints
- idk
- Ethically, there will always be moral concerns with accepting/offering rides with/to people you are not completely familiar with. Also, privacy issues...
### Resources
- All of the resources we plan to utilize are easily accessible.
### Descoping
- If our full functionality cannot be implemented, an application with reduced functionality will still achieve the basic idea of our concept.
